## What We Have Done So Far

Think of the project like building a house. So far, we have laid the foundation and set up the workshop.

1.  **Project Blueprint Created:** We have a detailed plan called the `Steering Document.md`. It describes what the app will do, who it's for, and how we'll build it.

2.  **Basic Structure is Ready:** The initial project files and folders have been created. This is like having the frame of the house built.

3.  **Tools are Set Up:** We've chosen our main tools and configured them:
    - **React & Vite:** This is our primary toolset for building the user interface (what you see and interact with).
    - **TypeScript:** This helps us write safer and more reliable code.
    - **Tailwind CSS:** This will help us style the app to make it look good.
    - **ESLint & Prettier:** These tools help keep our code clean and consistent.

Right now, we have a standard, empty "template" application. The next steps will be to start building the actual features.

## What's Next?

Continuing our house analogy, now we need to do the plumbing, wiring, and start building the rooms.

1.  **Set Up Testing:** We need to prepare our testing tools (`Vitest` and `Playwright`) to make sure the app works correctly as we build it.

2.  **Connect to the Cloud (Firebase):** We will connect the app to Firebase, a service from Google. This will handle:
    - **User Accounts:** So adults can sign in securely.
    - **Saving Data:** To store information about children, tasks, stars, and rewards.
    - **Hosting:** To make the app available on the internet.

3.  **Build the Core Features:** Once Firebase is connected, we will start building the main parts of the app, including:
    - Screens for signing in.
    - A way to add children and tasks.
    - Buttons to award stars.
    - A list of rewards.

We are at the very beginning of this exciting journey. The foundation is solid, and we are now ready to start building the app itself!
