## About This Project

This is a personal project to explore and document the process of building a modern, full-stack application using AI-powered development tools.

The goal is to maintain a structured, phased approach, using this repository to track progress from the initial concept to a production-ready app. All high-level planning, architecture, and phasing are detailed in the [[Steering Document]]
